## Overview

This repository contains the replication code and cleaned data for the main regression analysis reported in our iScience paper. The analysis examines the impact of COVID-19 deaths on electricity consumption across different building types in [Location], using a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) instrumental variable approach.

## Requirements

### Software
